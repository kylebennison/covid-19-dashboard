# covid-19-dashboard
This is a dashboard built in R with Shiny used to track COVID-19 new and total cases at the county, state, and country level.  

In addition, this I have pulled in testing and hospitalization data which is currently available at the state-level.  

## project goal
The goal of this project is to better-inform average citizens, as well as decision-makers, about the true reality and spread of COVID-19 in their area. This model could be applied to other localized outbreaks in the future.  

## data sources
all current case data comes from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/">Johns Hopkins</a>  

all testing data comes from <a href="https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/daily">covidtracking.com API</a>
